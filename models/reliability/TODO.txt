TEST CASES:

DO:
	add copyrights

	tweak default parameters for more meaningful output

    
VALIDATE RESULTS
	test my results vs servethehome.com/raid-calclulator
		they support RAID-0 and get a very different number than I do
		we used to agree on RAID-1 (do we still)
		2+1 ... I say .000124, they say .00052
		6+2 ...	I say 1.6E-9, they say 6E-6
		but they are counting reads and writes, which I should

	but reconsider what I want to do with it,
	    come up with a new model for what it should be in each
		disk does NRE probability and loss computations
		disk incorporates scrubbing
		?does disk control the nre model?
	    come up with a new code refactoring for who does what
	    implement it

	AND ... there was another calculator


INVESTIGATE:

FIX     1 site 3cp is 200x more reliable than 3site 1cp
	because my psc computation for the third failure still
	assumes that I need NPG drives after 2nd drive failure

CONSIDER ADD fit2 support to the DiskRely

CONSIDER ADD scrubbing and scrub efficacy in eliminating NREs

CONSIDER ADD RAID stripes on top of the others
