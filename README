This repository contains a couple of scripts which can help you backup metadata
from a running Ceph cluster.

In the end RADOS objects are nothing more then regular files on the OSD's filesystem.

Should for any reason, while very unlikely, your complete Ceph cluster stop working you
can reconstruct RBD images from OSDs their harddrives if you have the right meta information.

Running "rbd-meta-backup" on a regular basis will allow you to do so.

The ceph-meta-backup tool will backup information like monitor maps, osdmaps and crushmaps so
you can use this information to restore after a user error. Having a old version of your crushmap
can be useful when you import a new crushmap and it contains an error.
